There is only a handful of banks that have a dedicated developer portal, and Investec is one of them. The developer portal is a one-stop-shop for developers to access the APIs and documentation they need to build applications on top of the Investec platform.

Whats even better is you do not require an account, no need to sign any nda, you can just start building.
